RapidStream TAPA (FPGA)
###############################

`RapidStream TAPA <https://github.com/rapidstream-org/rapidstream-tapa>`_ is an open-source backend that enables agile synthesis for designing high-frequency FPGA dataflow accelerators. Please refer to their `TRETS papers <https://doi.org/10.1145/3593025>`_ for more details.
It still requires the `Vitis HLS <https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis/vitis-hls.html>`_ toolchain to generate hardware accelerators for FPGA devices, so please set up the environment in advance. This document demonstrates how to define a general matrix multiplication (GEMM) kernel using the Allo ADL and generate TAPA code for FPGA synthesis.

Kernel Definition
-----------------
The GEMM kernel is implemented using `float32` precision and pre-defined constants for the matrix dimensions. The kernel utilizes the `allo.grid` API to iterate over output indices and the `allo.reduction` API to designate the reduction axis for accumulating the dot-product.

.. code-block:: python

   import allo
   from allo.ir.types import float32
   import numpy as np

   # Define matrix dimensions
   M, N, K = 32, 32, 32

   def gemm(A: int32[32, 32], B: int32[32, 32]) -> int32[32, 32]:
       C: int32[32, 32] = 0
       for i, j, k in allo.grid(32, 32, 32):
           C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
       return C

Code Generation for RapidStream TAPA
-------------------------------------
Allo supports the generation of TAPA code by setting the target to `"tapa"`. Four synthesis modes are available:

- ``csim``: C simulation mode, which compiles the design for software simulation.
- ``fast_hw_emu``: Fast hardware emulation mode developed by RapidStream, offering a rapid emulation of the hardware design.
- ``hw_emu``: Hardware emulation mode, synthesizing the design into an RTL model and simulating it on an FPGA emulator.
- ``hw``: Full hardware synthesis mode, performing complete synthesis, placement, routing, and bitstream generation for execution on FPGA hardware.

.. code-block:: python

   s = allo.customize(gemm)
   mod = s.build(target="tapa", mode="hw_emu", project="gemm.prj")
   print(mod)

Project Structure and Execution
-------------------------------
The generated TAPA project (e.g., in the folder ``gemm.prj``) typically includes:

- **host.cpp**: The host (CPU) code that interfaces with the generated accelerator.
- **kernel.cpp**: The accelerator kernel code generated for TAPA.
- **Makefile**: Build scripts that streamline the project compilation.

To execute the design, prepare the input matrices using NumPy. For instance, generate random matrices for the inputs and allocate an output array:

.. code-block:: python

   np_A = np.random.random((M, K)).astype(np.float32)
   np_B = np.random.random((K, N)).astype(np.float32)
   allo_C = np.zeros((M, N), dtype=np.float32)
   mod(np_A, np_B, allo_C)
   np.testing.assert_allclose(allo_C, np.matmul(np_A, np_B), rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-5)

Note:
  Ensure that the TAPA and required toolchain environments are correctly configured before running the flow. For further environment setup and detailed information on synthesis modes, please consult the `RapidStream TAPA <https://tapa.readthedocs.io/en/main/>`_ documentation.
