Environment Setup
=================

Prerequisites
-------------

Before proceeding with the Allo installation, please follow the instructions on the `MLIR-AIE website <https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-for-amd-ryzen-ai---linux-quick-setup-instructions>`_ to install the required `Vitis <https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis.html>`_ and XRT environment. Stop when you reach the "Install IRON for AMD Ryzenâ„¢ AI AIE Application" section as we need a separate process to install MLIR-AIE under the Allo environment.


Install from Source
-------------------

Please follow the general instructions in :ref:`Install from Source <install-from-source>` to install the LLVM-19 project and the Allo package. In the following, we suppose you have already installed the LLVM-19 project, cloned Allo repository and created the ``allo`` conda environment.

Below are the exact commands to set up the environment:

Step 1
~~~~~~
Activate the ``allo`` conda environment

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate allo

Step 2
~~~~~~
We depend on the `MLIR-AIE <https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie>`_ project to compile the Allo IR to AIE. Install release 1.0

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install IRON library and mlir-aie from a wheel
   python3 -m pip install mlir_aie -f https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie/releases/expanded_assets/v1.0
   # Install Peano from a llvm-aie wheel
   python3 -m pip install https://github.com/Xilinx/llvm-aie/releases/download/nightly/llvm_aie-19.0.0.2025041501+b2a279c1-py3-none-manylinux_2_27_x86_64.manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl


.. warning::

   The ``mlir_aie`` wheel requires ``manylinux_2_35``, and some systems (e.g., those with glibc 2.34, confirmed by ``ldd --version``) do not meet this requirement.  
   This results in an installation failure such as:

   ``ERROR: mlir_aie-0.0.1.2025042204+24208c0-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_35_x86_64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.``

.. _step3:

Step 3
~~~~~~
Enter the Allo repository and install.

Enter the ``scripts`` directory

.. code-block:: bash

   cd scripts

Set up MLIR-AIE by running the setup script

.. code-block:: bash

   source aie-setup.sh

.. note::

   This will clone the ``mlir-aie`` repository and checkout to the commit corresponding to release 1.0. 
   
   By default, the repository is cloned under Allo's root directory. To customize the installation directory, 
   use the ``--clone-dir`` option.

   .. code-block:: bash

      source aie-setup.sh --clone-dir /customized/path/

   After running the setup script, you may see the following message in the terminal:

   .. code-block:: text

      >>> Please note: Each time you activate your environment, you need to export the following variables:
      export PATH=/path/to/your/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mlir_aie/bin:$PATH
      export MLIR_AIE_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mlir_aie
      export PEANO_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/your/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/llvm-aie
      export MLIR_AIE_EXTERNAL_KERNEL_DIR=/path/to/mlir-aie/aie_kernels/
      export RUNTIME_LIB_DIR=/path/to/mlir-aie/runtime_lib/
      export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mlir_aie/python:$PYTHONPATH

   You can copy the export commands listed here into your own script (e.g., ``/path/to/your/env/etc/conda/activate.d/setup.sh``), so that these environment variables are automatically set whenever you activate your environment.


To build and install Allo, you may want to set up environment variables first to use a custom CMake and LLVM build. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   export PATH=/opt/cmake-3.31.5-linux-x86_64/bin:/opt/llvm-project-19.x/build/bin:$PATH
   export LLVM_BUILD_DIR=/opt/llvm-project-19.x/build

Next, enter Allo's root directory and install by running the following commands

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m pip install -v -e .

.. note::

   See :ref:`internal_install` for Zhang Group students.

.. _step4:

Step 4
~~~~~~
Setup Vitis and XRT.

.. note::

   See :ref:`internal_install` for Zhang Group students.

Lastly, you can verify the AIE backend by running the following command under Allo's root directory.

.. code-block:: console

   python3 tests/dataflow/aie/test_vector.py


.. _internal_install:

Internal Installation (Cornell)
-------------------------------

For Zhang Group students, please set up environment variables in :ref:`step3` with the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

   export PATH=/opt/cmake-3.31.5-linux-x86_64/bin:/opt/llvm-project-19.x/build/bin:$PATH  
   export LLVM_BUILD_DIR=/opt/llvm-project-19.x/build

And set up Vitis and XRT in :ref:`step4` by running the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

   source /opt/common/setupVitis.sh
   source /opt/common/setupXRT.sh


Lastly, to verify the installation, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   python3 tests/dataflow/aie/test_vector.py

If the unit tests pass, then the installation is successful. Otherwise, please contact us for help.
