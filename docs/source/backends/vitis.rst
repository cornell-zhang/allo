AMD Vitis HLS (FPGA)
############################

The `Vitis HLS <https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis/vitis-hls.html>`_ FPGA backend leverages the Vivado/Vitis HLS toolchain to generate hardware accelerators for FPGA devices. This document demonstrates how to define a general matrix multiplication (GEMM) kernel using the Allo ADL and generate HLS code for FPGA synthesis. For more details on kernel customizations and scheduling optimizations, please refer to the `Allo-HLS tutorial <https://cornell-zhang.github.io/allo/gallery/tutorial_02_vhls.html>`_.

Kernel Definition
-----------------
The GEMM kernel is implemented with `float32` precision using pre-defined constants for the matrix dimensions. The kernel utilizes the `allo.grid` API to iterate over output indices and the `allo.reduction` API to designate the reduction axis for accumulating the dot-product.

.. code-block:: python

   import allo
   from allo.ir.types import float32
   import numpy as np

   # Define matrix dimensions
   M, N, K = 32, 32, 32

   def gemm(A: int32[32, 32], B: int32[32, 32]) -> int32[32, 32]:
       C: int32[32, 32] = 0
       for i, j, k in allo.grid(32, 32, 32):
           C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
       return C

Code Generation for Vivado/Vitis HLS
------------------------------------
Allo supports several approaches to generate HLS code:

1. **Direct HLS Code Generation**:  
   Set the target to `"vhls"` to produce HLS code as a string. This code includes the necessary headers and pragmas for Vitis HLS synthesis.

    .. code-block:: python

       code = s.build(target="vhls")
       print(code)

2. **HLS Emulation, Synthesis, and Execution**:  
   Specify the target as `"vitis_hls"` along with a synthesis mode and project name to generate a complete HLS project. The supported modes are:

   - ``sw_emu``: Software emulation mode, which is similar to C simulation that compiles the program using C compiler and runs it on the CPU. Depending on the size of your input data, this mode may take within one minute.
   - ``hw_emu``: Hardware emulation mode, which is similar to co-simulation that compiles the program into RTL design using HLS compiler and runs the RTL with the test bench on the FPGA emulator. Since it needs to go through the HLS synthesis flow, it may take several minutes to finish.
   - ``hw``: Full hardware synthesis mode, which compiles the program into RTL design using HLS, goes through placement and routing, generates the bitstream, and finally executes on FPGA. This mode may take several hours to finish.

    .. code-block:: python

       mod = s.build(target="vitis_hls", mode="hw_emu", project="gemm.prj")

3. **(Legacy) HLS Synthesis**:  
   Set the target to `"vivado_hls"` to generate a legacy HLS project. This approach is similar to the previous one but uses ``run.tcl`` for the project script. The supported modes are:

   - ``csim``: C simulation mode, using the gcc compiler to compile the program and runs it on the CPU.
   - ``csyn``: C synthesis mode, using Vivado HLS compiler to synthesize the program. **Note: This mode only synthesize the program and generate the RTL design but does not execute the program!**
   - ``cosim``: Co-simulation mode, using Vivado HLS compiler to synthesize the program and generate the RTL design, then runs the RTL with the test bench on the CPU.
   - ``impl``: Implementation mode, using Vivado HLS compiler to synthesize the program, generate the RTL design, and go through placement and routing to the bitstream.

   .. code-block:: python

      mod = s.build(target="vivado_hls", mode="csim", project="gemm.prj")
      # For csim
      mod(np_A, np_B, allo_C)
      # For csyn
      mod()


Project Structure and Execution
-------------------------------
The generated HLS project (e.g., in the folder ``gemm.prj``) typically includes:

- **host.cpp**: The host-side (CPU) code that invokes the accelerator.
- **kernel.cpp**: The accelerator kernel code.
- **Makefile**: Build scripts to compile the project.

To run the design, prepare the input matrices using NumPy and allocate an output array for the result:

.. code-block:: python

   np_A = np.random.random((M, K)).astype(np.float32)
   np_B = np.random.random((K, N)).astype(np.float32)
   allo_C = np.zeros((M, N), dtype=np.float32)
   mod(np_A, np_B, allo_C)
   np.testing.assert_allclose(allo_C, np.matmul(np_A, np_B), rtol=1e-5, atol=1e-5)

Note:
  Ensure that the Vitis HLS and XRT environments are correctly configured before running the HLS flow. For further environment setup and synthesis mode details, please consult the `Vitis HLS <https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/vitis/vitis-hls.html>`_ documentation.

Conclusion
----------
This example illustrates the process of defining a GEMM kernel using the Allo ADL and generating HLS code for FPGA acceleration with the Vitis HLS backend. The approach supports various synthesis modes (sw_emu, hw_emu, hw) to cater to different design and verification needs.
