Developer Setup

To contribute to the Allo project, you need to follow the guideline below to make sure your changes are consistent with the existing codebase.


Upstream Changes
----------------

It would be good to maintain your own `fork <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ of
the Allo repository, which helps create a `PR (pull request) <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_ and upstream changes easier.

To create your own fork, click on the "Fork" button on the top right of the `Allo repository <https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo>`_.
This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

Next, you can clone your fork to your local machine OR if you have already cloned the Allo repository, you can add your fork as a remote:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Change OWNER to your GitHub username
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/OWNER/allo.git
    # Update upstream
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo.git

And then you can verify the remotes:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git remote -v
    > origin  https://github.com/OWNER/allo.git (fetch)
    > origin  https://github.com/OWNER/allo.git (push)
    > upstream https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo.git (fetch)
    > upstream https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo.git (push)

Basically, the development workflow is as follows:

1. Create a new branch from the ``main`` branch (``git checkout -b <branch_name> main``)
2. Make changes to the code
3. Commit the changes to your *local* branch (``git commit -m "commit message"``)
4. Push the changes to your *fork* (``git push origin <branch_name>``)
5. Make sure your changes do not break the existing facilities, see `Integration Tests <#integration-tests>`_ for more details
6. Create a `Pull Request (PR) <https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo/pulls>`_ from your fork to the ``main`` branch of the Allo repository (see `here <https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_ for more details)
7. Wait for the PR to be reviewed
8. If there are any changes requested, make the changes and push to your fork
9. Once the PR is approved, it will be merged into the ``main`` branch

Most of the ``git`` features are integrated in VSCode, please refer to the `document <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git>`_ if you want to use the GUI.

Integration Tests
-----------------
We have configured `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`_ to run the tests on every PR, so please
make sure you have passed the tests locally before creating a PR or pushing to your fork.

There are several tests for our project:

1. **License header check**: make sure all the source files have the license header, which is important for open source projects.
2. **Code style check**: make sure the Python code style is consistent with the `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ standard. We use ``black`` for Python formatting, which should has been installed in your environment during the setup. For the MLIR part, we use ``clang-format`` for C/C++ formatting.
3. **Linting check**: make sure the code is `linted <https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/what-lint-code-and-what-linting-and-why-linting-important>`_ correctly. We use ``pylint`` for Python linting, which should also been installed during the setup.
4. **Unit tests**: make sure the changes will not break the existing facilities. We use ``pytest`` for Python unit tests, and the test cases are under the ``tests`` folder.

If you are making changes to the code, please make sure to run those tests and checking before pushing to your fork.
To run the format checker, you can execute the following command from the root of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bash scripts/lint/task_lint.sh

Following is an example output:

.. code-block::

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: 10.00/10, +0.00)

Lastly run the unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m pytest tests

If no error is reported, hurrah, you are good to go!
