Allo is a Python-embedded Accelerator Design Language (ADL) and compiler that facilitates the construction of large-scale, high-performance hardware accelerators in a modular and composable manner. Allo has several key features:
* **Progressive hardware customizations**: Allo decouples hardware customizations from algorithm specifications and treats each hardware customization as a primitive that performs a rewrite on the program. Allo not only decouples the loop-based transformations, but also extends the decoupling to memory, communication, and data types. All the transformations are built on top of [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) that is easier to target different backends.
* **Reusable parameterized kernel templates**: Allo supports declaring type variables during kernel creation and instantiating the kernel when building the hardware executable, which is an important feature for building reusable hardware kernel libraries. Allo introduces a concise grammar for creating kernel templates, eliminating the need for users to possess complicated metaprogramming expertise.
* **Composable schedules**: Allo empowers users to construct kernels incrementally from the bottom up, adding customizations one at a time while validating the correctness of each submodule. Ultimately, multiple schedules are progressively integrated into a complete design using the `.compose()` primitive. This approach, unachievable by prior top-down methods, significantly enhances productivity and debuggability.
