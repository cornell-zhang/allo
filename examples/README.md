# Examples

This folder contains examples of using Allo to design hardware accelerators for various applications.

## PolyBench
[PolyBench](https://github.com/MatthiasJReisinger/PolyBenchC-4.2.1) is a C-based benchmark suite that contains a set of kernels commonly used in scientific computing. We provide Allo implementations under the [`polybench`](polybench/) folder. For example, you can directly run the GEMM kernel using the CPU backend by typing the following command:
```bash
python3 polybench/gemm.py
```

For comparison between Allo and other baseline systems, please refer to our [PLDI'24 artifact repository](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo-pldi24-artifact) for more details.


## Transformer Models
We propose an analytical framework to predict the performance of FPGA-based spatial accelerators for large language model (LLM) inference. Please refer to our [FCCM'24 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15159) for more details.

Our implementation of the Transformer kernel library using Allo can be found in [nn.py](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo/blob/main/allo/library/nn.py). Example usage is demonstrated in [test_nn.py](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo/blob/main/tests/test_nn.py).

To facilitate the use of the HLS library, we also provide a script for quickly generating HLS code for each kernel. Please install Allo first following the [instruction](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). Currently, we support the following arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--func` | The kernel name. Supported kernels: `gemm`, `sdp`, `softmax`, `layernorm`, `gelu`. |
| `--dtype` | The data type of the kernel. Supported data types: `float`, `int8`, etc. |
| `--H` | The number of attention heads. |
| `--L` | The input sequence length. |
| `--D` | The hidden dimension. |
| `--Dffn` | The hidden dimension of the FFN layer. |
| `--M0` | The size of systolic array (first dimension). |
| `--M1` | The size of systolic array (second dimension). |

For example, you can generate the HLS code for the int8 GEMM kernel with a 16x16 systolic array implementation using the following command:
```bash
python3 transformer_hls.py --func gemm --dtype float --M0 16 --M1 16
```

We plan to deploy our compiler on a website to provide more accesible HLS code generation in the future. Please stay tuned.
