# Allo-PyTorch Examples

Please follow the instructions on the PyTorch [website](https://pytorch.org/) to install the latest version of PyTorch.

We recommend installing the stable 2.0.1 version. You can directly install it with pip if the CUDA environment is already set up:

```bash
pip install torch
```
